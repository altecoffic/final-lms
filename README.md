This Library Management System can perform basic crud which mainly focuses on the admin side. It can add borrower/student and books as well. It can also perform crud type when reserving books, lostbook and generate fines.

You can clone or download this source code but you must include in the library those jar/rar files inside the jarfiles folder.
 
 Hope this could help you.
